                    <h2>EXAM FOR THE COURSE: </h2>
                    <p>The only medical entrance exam for medical students after 12th in India is the National
                        Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). NEET is a single, national-level entrance examination
                        conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for admission to undergraduate medical programs
                        in India. NEET is a mandatory entrance exam for admission to MBBS, BDS, BAMS, BUMS, BHMS, and
                        other undergraduate medical courses in all government and private medical colleges in India.
                        NEET is a pen-and-paper based test that is conducted for three hours. The exam consists of 200
                        multiple-choice questions from Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The questions are based on the
                        NCERT syllabus for Class 11th and 12th.
                        <br>
                        To be eligible for NEET, candidates must have passed Class 12th with PCB (Physics, Chemistry,
                        and Biology) as major subjects. Candidates must also have scored at least 50% in PCB in their
                        Class 12th board exams. Reserved category candidates (SC, ST, and OBC) are required to score at
                        least 40% in PCB in their Class 12th board exams.
                        NEET is a highly competitive exam, and the cut-off marks for admission to medical colleges are
                        very high. To get into a good medical college, candidates need to score at least 600 marks out
                        of 720 in NEET.
                        Here are some tips for preparing for NEET:
                        <br>
                        • Start preparing early. NEET is a vast syllabus, so it is important to start preparing
                        early.<br>
                        • Create a study plan and stick to it.<br>

                        • Practice solving previous year's NEET question papers.<br>
                        • Take mock tests to assess your preparation level.<br>
